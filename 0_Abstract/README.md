# Distance Measurement using HC-SR04 and AVR Microcontroller
    -> This circuit is developed by interfacing ultrasonic sensor "HC-SR04" with AVR microcontroller "Atmega328" . This sensor uses a technique called "ECHO" which is something you get when sound reflects back after striking with a surface.
