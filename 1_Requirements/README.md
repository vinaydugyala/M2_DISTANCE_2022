# SWOT ANALYSIS

#### STRENGTH:

 -> Not affected by color or transparency of objects Ultrasonic sensors reflect sound off of objects, so the color or transparency have no effect on the sensor’s reading.
 
 -> Can be used in dark environments Unlike proximity sensors using light or cameras, dark environments have no effect on an ultrasonic sensor’s detection ability.

 -> Low-cost option .They come fully calibrated and ready to use. We strive to give a low cost, high-quality product suited for specific needs.

 -> They have greater accuracy than many other methods at measuring thickness and distance to a parallel surface
 
 #### WEAKNESS:
  -> Cannot work in a vacuum Because ultrasonic sensors operate using sound, they are completely nonfunctional in a vacuum as there is no air for the sound to travel through.
  
  -> Not designed for underwater use.
  
  -> Sensing accuracy affected by soft materials Objects covered in a very soft fabric absorb more sound waves making it hard for the sensor to see the target.
  
  -> Have a limited detection range .At the moment, the longest range sensors have a maximum range of 10 meters, now our cargo sensor detects up to 16.5m.

#### OPPORTUNITIES:

 -> They are used within food and beverage to measure liquid level in bottles, they can be used within manufacturing for an automated process and control maximising efficiency on the factory floor.
 
 -> Their high frequency, sensitivity, and penetrating power make it easy to detect external or deep objects.
 
 #### THREATS:
 -> If we are using in foggy conditions Then the values might be change.
 
 -> if there any inteernal malfunction occur it may show wrong values.
